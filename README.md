# Traffic-Simulation
This simulation analyzes urban traffic dynamics in Berlin using a road network graph generated from OpenStreetMap data via Python's OSMnx library. The graph models intersections as nodes and directed road segments as edges, simulating vehicle movement, congestion patterns, and driver responses to real-time traffic conditions.
